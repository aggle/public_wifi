A place to collect all the tasks to do
* TODO linking tables to add: [0/2]                                :database:
** TODO tr14 star_id <--> ks2 NMAST
** TODO tr14 ps_id <--> ks2 point source composite key
* TODO add q to the fields list for stars and point sources. maybe just for point sources. :ana:
* TODO decide format for saving header tables                      :database:
Do I want them in separate CSV files, or in a single HDF file with different headers?
* TODO move ks2_utils.ks2_file paths to config.ini                      :ana:
* TODO write test for shared_utils.load_config_path                :ana:test:
* TODO save KS2 catalogs to the tables directory and read them from there :database:
* TODO finish writing ks2_utils.process_ks2_input_catalog()        :database:
  This function reads the KS2 output files, applies the cleaning and cutting procedures, and writes them to tables in the data directory

* TODO Settle on a common set of fields for the master and point source catalogs :database:
  So you can process the KS2 catalogs into the final form
   
* TODO find a way to collect all the table-generating functions in one place :database:
  So if you change the table format, you can run them all and recreate all the new tables at once
  - ks2_utils:
    - get_file_mapper()
    - get_filter_mapper()
    - get_master_catalog()
    - get_point_source_catalog()
  - header_utils:
    - write_headers()
  Remember, tables are written with table_utils.write_table()
* DONE move csv format dict from ks2_utils to table_utils          :database:
  CLOSED: [2020-06-22 Mon 00:20]
  This is for ensuring consistency in how the csv files are saved
