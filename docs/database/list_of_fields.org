#+TITLE: List of Fields
This document is used to create the lists of fields as suggested in Database Design for Mere Mortals

* Steps:
 1) [-] Review and refine the list of characteristics
    1) [X] Refine items with the same name
    2) [ ] Refine items representing the same characteristic
    3) [ ] Ensure each item represents a characteristic
 2) [ ] Determine whether there are new characteristics in any of your samples
    - Go through your notes (in my case, my ongoing analysis) and decide if there's anything new that's missing from these lists
 3) [ ] Separate the /calculated fields/ and place them in a new list
