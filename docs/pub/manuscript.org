* Introduction

* Observations

* Methods
** Initial data processing
   We work exclusively on the FLT files, so whatever was done to them goes here. I think this includes at least bias-subtraction and flat-fielding. 
** Making the catalog
   The initial catalog of point sources was created using KS2 cite:2013AJ....146...53S, so describe whatever that does here.
   The KS2 catalog was corrected for duplicates. We also required that any source have at least 10 detections in both filters.
   
* Results

* Conclusions
